Complete forward differencing algorithm

    - degenerate cases (e.g. no interior points, cylinder)
    - make UVS
    - approximate normals
    - exact normals
    - tests (spheres, circles)

BRep Split
    Holes are not recognized

BRep Bool
	Not complete

SweptSurface
More exact srf-srf intersection
SurfaceClosestPoint occasionally fails when point is far from surface - need to check for wild derivatives
Curve interpolation with sparse matrices
Curve approximation
verb.eval.Make.interpCurve with tangents is numerically unstable, implementation likely wrong
