# verb

<strong>verb</strong> is a library for creating and manipulating NURBS surfaces and curves in many languages including JavaScript.

These examples use the JavaScript import declaration to load Three.js, <strong>verb</strong> and WebWorker modules (libraries).

Each example is kept as simple as possible, creating surfaces, curves, etc.

The examples include specific functions which convert from VERB geometry to Three.js geometry,
and then render the Three.js geometry.

See the 'js' folder.

Please read through the examples if interested in specific VERB supplied functionality.

Because of CORS, these examples must be provided by a webserver. If you open one of the HTML files and see "Cross-Origin Request Blocked" then you will understand.

The easiest HTTP server is provided by NPM.

```
cd examplesES
npx http-server 
```

And follow the instructions to open one of the HTML pages.
