# verb

<strong>verb</strong> is a library for creating and manipulating NURBS surfaces and curves in many languages including JavaScript.

These examples use the JavaScript import declaration to load Three.js, VERB and WebWorker modules (libraries).

Each example is kept as simple as possible, creating surfaces, curves, etc.
The examples include specific functions which convert from VERB geometry to Three.js geometry.
And then the Three.js geometry is rendered.

Please read through the examples if interested in specific VERB supplied functionality.
